  <h1>Known problems</h1>
 <p><strong>Support on smartphones</strong></p>
 The initial "beta" version of National Map is not specifcally designed for use on smartphones.  It may have a reasonable level of functionality and performance on some devices (especially ones which have WebGL support) and not so great on others.  A future version of National Map will more specifically address use on smartphones. 
  <h1>Help and FAQ's</h1>
  <h2>GENERAL</h2>
  <p><strong>Q. How do I report bugs or suggestions for National Map?</strong><br>
Email us on <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au">nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a>  </p>
  <p><strong>Q: What is the National Map?</strong><br>
  A: The National Map is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies.  For more information, see the <a href="info.html">About page</a>.  The current version of the National Map is a &quot;beta&quot; service and we will be making lots of changes while we experiment with how users want to use the site and the data services.  Later in 2014, it will become a fully supported stable &quot;production&quot; site.  The site was first made available in July 2014 for Govhack 2014 to help developers access data through the National Map and also to build new value-add applications which extend its functionality.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: What data is available through the National Map?</strong><br>
  A: Current datasets cover information on land, water, infrastructure, broadband access, boundaries, population and more.  More data sets will be made available in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Who's behind the National Map?</strong><br>
  A: The National Map is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's <a href="http://www.communications.gov.au/">Department of Communications</a> and the software has been developed by <a href="http://nicta.com.au">NICTA</a> working closely with the Department of Communications, <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a> and other government agencies.  The current &quot;beta&quot; site is hosted by NICTA but the plan is that it will be hosted by Geoscience Australia when it reaches &quot;production&quot; stage.  The data services you can access through the National Map are hosted by government agencies such as <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a> and the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">Bureau of Meteorology</a>.  The National Map software builds heavily on the <a href="http://cesiumjs.org">Cesium</a> open source geospatial browser software and we have contributed changes to Cesium as part of National Map development.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Why are you doing the National Map?</strong><br>
  A: The National Map is part of the Australian Commonwealth Government's &quot;open data&quot; initiative to make Australian government data more easily available and used.  The National Map makes spatial data available allowing startups, small businesses, large businesses and communities to develop new products and services that use this data.</p>
   <p><strong>Q: How do I use the National Map?</strong><br>
   A: Go to <a href="http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/">http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/</a> and press on the "Data" button (below the search entry bar) and then select "Data Sets".  This will show you a list of topics of data available.  Select a topic to show the data sets then check the box next to a data set to display the data set.  The data you will see is, in most cases, coming directly from a government agency who is providing the data (such as Geoscience Australia or the Bureau of Meteorology).  Pressing on the name of the data set will zoom the map to the area of the data (or the whole of Australia if it covers the whole country).  Pressing on "info" will show you more info about a data set (including usage conditions) or let you download it for use with other applications.  When a data set is loaded on the map, you can usually click/press on the map to find out more information about that point in the data set (for example, for the data set "Railways", you can click on a railway line and find out more about it - for boundary data, you can press inside the boundary to find out what region it is).</p>   
  <p><strong>Q: How much data does the National Map store?</strong><br>
A: None.  The National Map is a front-end that runs inside a web browser and connects directly to other data repositories that are managed by government departments and agencies.  The National Map brings the data together for viewing on a single map but it does not actually store the data.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: How does the National Map relate to <a href="http://data.gov.au">http://data.gov.au</a> - the Australian government open data hub?</strong><br>
  A: The National Map does not store data or even have a data catalogue. The National Map relies on other services to supply data and catalogue services.  The National Map software running in the browser talks directly to data.gov.au and can be used to view any spatial data service provided by data.gov.au.  It also provides access to other Australian government data services directly. Also data.gov.au now uses National Map embedded in it so that spatial data sets available viewed from data.gov.au can be shown inside National Map (including the ability to add in other data sets and services for viewing at the same time).</p>

  <h2>QUESTIONS FROM USERS</h2>
  <strong>Q: What data formats are supported?</strong><br>
  A: GeoJSON, KML, KMZ, CSV (with latitude and longitude columns) and various other formats.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: What browsers are supported?</strong><br>
  A: It is best to use a browser with WebGL support such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 11.  It will also work in some older browsers (eg IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited (eg it will not support 3D rendering of maps).</p>
  <p><strong>Q: National Map seems to run very slowly on my system.  What can I do?</strong><br>
  A: Browser and graphics performance can vary greatly across different computers.  We try to detect performance issues and switch to the much less demanding 2D mode when issues are detected.  If the system is not switching to this mode automatically, you can switch to it by clicking on the Maps button at the top right and selecting 2D.  You can also automatically start up in 2D mode by using the link <a href="http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/?map=2d">http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/?map=2d</a> .</p>

  <h2>QUESTIONS FROM SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS</h2>
  <p><strong>Q: How can developers build new products and services using the National Map?</strong><br>
    A: There are a few ways you can use the National Map including:<br>
     - Use the National Map to find data sets and services (for any data set or service visible in the National Map, press &quot;info&quot; to get more info about the data set/service and to find out how to access the data set/service directly.<br>
     - Set up a Web Map Service (WMS) or Web Feature Service (WFS) and load the URL for that service in the National Map.  For example, you can use the open source software Geoserver to do this or use one of many commercial GIS systems such as ESRI ArcGIS Server, Pitney Bowes' Mapinfo or Google Maps Engine and enable WMS and/or WFS services from it.<br>
   - Build a website that uses the value-add service API.  Email us at <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au">nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a> to find out how.  More inforrmation will be made available on this soon.</p>

  <h2>QUESTIONS FROM DATA OWNERS</h2>
  <p>Q: I'm a data owner in Australia. How do I get my data on to National Map?<br>
    A: One way you can do this is to upload your data into data.gov.au.  There are also other ways - for example if it makes sense to have live access to your data services.  Email us at <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au">nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a> and we can discuss this with you in more detail.  There will be more information made available for (current and prospective) data owners soon.</p>

  <h2>QUESTIONS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>
  <p>Q: I like the National Map.  How can I set one up for my country, my city or for the world?<br>
    A: Email <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au">nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a> and we can discuss this with you in more detail.</p>
