                <h1>About AURIN Map</h1>
              </div>
<p>The AURIN Map is a website for map-based access to spatial data relevant to urban infrastructure from Australian government agencies and data custodians. It is funded by the <a href=http://aurin.org.au">Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)</a>, an e-infrastructure project made possible through the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">Commonwealth National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)</a>. The University of Melbourne, as AURIN's Lead Agent, administers and operates AURIN.</p>
<p>The AURIN Map web-site is an extension of the Australian government's <a href=http://nationalmap.gov.au/>National Map</a> initiative. It uses <a href=http://terria.io/>TerriaJS</a> technologies developed for National Map, in collaboration with <a href=https://www.nicta.com.au/>National ICT Australia Limited (NICTA)</a>, now part of <a href=http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/D61>Data 61</a>.</p>

<p>AURIN Map provides access to datasets on urban infrastructure for urban researchers, policy and decision makers.</p>
<p>AURIN Map:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides easy access to spatial data on urban infrastructure for government and industry</li>
<li>supports federal and state government open data initiatives</li>
<li>provides an open framework for access to datasets that supports innovation</li>

<p>To find out what data is available on AURIN Map, refer to the Data Catalogue on the <a href=http://map.aurin.org.au>AURIN Map</a>. Click the Data Catalogue tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>

<p>AURIN Map complements core AURIN e-infrastructure, the <a href=https://portal.aurin.org.au/>AURIN Portal</a> and <a href=http://aurin.org.au/workbench/>Workbench</a>. AURIN has created the AURIN Portal and Workbench to link urban researchers, policy and decision makers with data, analytical tools and visualisation components to improve decision making within Australian cities and regions.</p>

<h2>How to use AURIN Map</h2>
<p>To use AURIN map, simply select some datasets to display from the <strong>Data Catalogue</strong>.  You can then control the display of the datasets on the map by clicking on the <strong>Now Viewing</strong> pane.  You can control opacity with the slider, whether the layer is shown with the <strong>"eye" icon</strong>, and you can drag the layers up and down to control the order in which they are stacked on the map by dragging the hamburger icon (&#9776;) up and down.  You can <strong>zoom</strong> in or out on the map using your <strong>mouse wheel</strong>, with <strong>pinch gestures</strong> on a touch screen device, or with the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Some datasets only cover capital cities</strong>; you will need to <strong>zoom in</strong> before these become visible.  Equally, some datasets include very small features which require you to zoom in before they become visible.</p>
<p>You can select from an array of different base maps, and whether the map is displayed in 2D or 3D, by clicking the <strong>Base Maps</strong> button.</p>
<p>You can display your own datasets on the map using the <strong>Add data</strong> button.</p>
<p>The metadata for the map layers is available through the <strong>(i)</strong> button next to each datset.  The metadata includes a link to the <strong>Web Map Service URL</strong> which, along with the <strong>layer name</strong>, can be used to import the layer's data into a GIS tool of your choice.  For example, to display a data set as a <strong>WFS</strong> layer in <a href=https://qgis.org>QGIS</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>click <strong>Layer -&gt; Add Layer -&gt; Add WFS Layer...</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Server connections</strong> click <strong>New</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> of your choosing, copy/paste the Web Map Service URL into the <strong>URL</strong> field, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the layer you wish to display and click the <strong>Add</strong> button.  Once the layer has loaded, click the <strong>Close</strong> button.
<li>It is also possible to display the datasets as <strong>WMS</strong> layers which will include all of the styling.
</ul>
