An 11 digit field with the first digit being the state code. |\n| wkb_geometry | Geometry |\n| mb_cat11 | Mesh Block Category is based on planning/zoning scheme data provided by each state/territory. The ABS consolidated the files for each state/territory then mapped the land uses to a highly generalised set of land uses. The ABS acknowledges that this planning data represents a planned land use and there will be many cases where actual land use is quite different to the planned land use. The Mesh Block category shown in the Mesh Blocks boundary dataset is not designed to provide a definitive land use mapping, it is purely an indicator of the main planned land use for a Mesh Block. Valid MB_Category values are; Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural, Parkland, Educational, Hospital/Medical, Transport, Water, Shipping and Other. |\n| sa1_main11 | Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) Code. SA1s are not named. They are identified either by an 11-digit fully hierarchical code, or by a truncated 7-digit code comprising the S/T, SA2 and SA1 identifiers. The SA1 identifier is a 2-digit code, assigned within an SA2. An SA1 code is only unique within an S/T when it is preceded by the S/T identifier. SA1s are built from whole Mesh Blocks. The SA1s have been designed as the smallest unit for the release of Census data. |\n| sa2_main11 | Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Code. An SA2 is identifiable either by a 9-digit fully hierarchical code, or by a truncated 5-digit code comprising the S/T and SA2 identifiers. The SA2 identifier is a 4-digit code, assigned in alphabetical order within an SA3. An SA2 code is only unique within an S/T if it is preceded by the S/T identifier. The SA2s are a general-purpose medium-sized area built from whole SA1s. Their aim is to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically. |\n| sa2_name11 | Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Name. In large urban areas, SA2s are named for the gazetted suburbs that comprise them. In rural areas, SA2s are named for the gazetted localities that comprise them, or the towns, city, or region with which they are associated. |\n| sa3_code11 | Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) Code. An SA3 is identified by a 5-digit hierarchical code. This comprises a 1-digit S/T identifier followed by a 2-digit SA4 identifier, unique within each S/T, and a 2-digit SA3 identifier, unique within each SA4. SA3s are built from whole SA2s. The SA3s provide a standardised regional breakup of Australia. The aim of SA3s is to create a standard framework for the analysis of ABS data at the regional level through clustering groups of SA2s that have similar regional characteristics. |\n| sa3_name11 | Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) Name. SA3s are named according to the areas they represent. |\n| sa4_code11 | Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) Code. An SA4 is identified by a 3-digit hierarchical code. This comprises a 1-digit S/T identifier, which precedes a 2-digit SA4 identifier, which is unique within each S/T. SA4s are built from whole SA3s. The SA4 regions are the largest sub-State regions in the Main Structure of the ASGS. They are designed for the output of labour force data and reflect labour markets within each State and Territory within the population limits imposed by the Labour Force Survey sample. SA4s provide the best sub-state socio-economic breakdown in the ASGS. |\n| sa4_name11 | Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) Name. SA4s are named according to the areas they represent. |\n| gcc_code11 | Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) Code. For the 2011 edition of the ASGS, there are 16 GCCSA regions. GCCSAs are aggregates of SA4s. The GCCSAs represent the socio-economic extent of each of the eight State and Territory capital cities. |\n| gcc_name11 | Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) Name. GCCSAs are named according to the cities they represent, for example, Greater Melbourne. The remainder of the S/T is named Rest of <State>, for example, Rest of VIC. |\n| ste_code11 | State Code |\n| ste_name11 | State Name |\n| persons_usually_resident | This is the count of people where they usually live, which may or may not be where they were on Census Night. This data is coded from the address supplied to the question: Where does the person usually live? For more information about usual residence, see Place of Usual Residence in the Census Dictionary, 2011 (cat. no. 2901.0). |\n| dwellings | A dwelling is a structure which is intended to have people live in it, and which is habitable on Census Night. Some examples of dwellings are houses, motels, flats, caravans, prisons, tents, humpies and houseboats. All occupied dwellings are counted in the Census. Unoccupied private dwellings are also counted with the exception of those in caravan parks, marinas and manufactured home estates. For more information about dwellings, see Dwelling Type in the Census Dictionary, 2011 (cat. no. 2901.0). |\n| persons_us | Persons Usually Resident |\n| pur_p_sqkm | Persons Usually Resident per Square Kilometre |\n| pur_p_ha | Persons Usually Resident per Hectare |\n<br>Areas calculated using GDA_1994_Australia_Albers projection."
